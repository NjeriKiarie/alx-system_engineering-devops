#Postmortem: Website Outage on August 17, 2024
##Issue Summary
###Duration of the Outage:
**Start:** August 17, 2024, 09:00 AM UTC
**End:** August 17, 2024, 10:30 AM UTC

###Impact:
Our main e-commerce website was completely inaccessible during the outage. Users attempting to access the site were met with a "503 Service Unavailable" error. Approximately 85% of our users were affected, resulting in significant revenue loss and a high volume of customer complaints.

###Root Cause:
The outage was caused by an unexpected spike in traffic due to a promotional event that was not properly accounted for in our server scaling policy. This overwhelmed the web servers, causing them to crash and become unresponsive.

##Timeline
-08:55 AM UTC: Promotional email sent to customers, triggering the traffic spike.
-09:00 AM UTC: Monitoring system triggered an alert for high CPU usage on the web servers.
-09:05 AM UTC: Engineer on call noticed the alert and began investigating.
-09:10 AM UTC: Initial assumption was a possible DDoS attack. Network traffic analysis was started.
-09:20 AM UTC: Web servers became unresponsive; incident was escalated to the DevOps team.
-09:30 AM UTC: Investigation revealed high traffic volume from legitimate users.
-09:45 AM UTC: Decision made to manually scale up the web server instances.
-10:00 AM UTC: Additional server instances were brought online, but the website remained inaccessible.
-10:15 AM UTC: Load balancer configuration was reviewed and adjusted to handle increased traffic.
-10:30 AM UTC: Website was restored to full functionality.

##Root Cause and Resolution

###Root Cause:
The primary cause of the outage was an inadequately configured auto-scaling policy. Our servers were not set up to handle the sudden influx of traffic from the promotional event, leading to CPU exhaustion and server crashes.

###Resolution:
The issue was resolved by manually scaling up the number of web server instances and reconfiguring the load balancer to distribute traffic more effectively. Additionally, the promotional event was temporarily paused to reduce incoming traffic while these changes were implemented.

##Corrective and Preventative Measures

###Improvements:

1. **Auto-scaling Configuration:** Review and update auto-scaling policies to ensure they can handle sudden traffic spikes, particularly during promotional events.
2. **Monitoring Enhancements:** Implement more granular monitoring and alerting for traffic patterns and server performance.
3. **Load Testing:** Conduct regular load testing to simulate high-traffic scenarios and ensure the infrastructure can handle peak loads.
4. **Communication Protocol:** Establish a clear communication protocol for handling similar incidents in the future, including rapid escalation procedures and predefined mitigation strategies.

###Task List:

1. **Update Auto-scaling Policy:** Reconfigure the auto-scaling settings to trigger earlier and add more instances as needed.
2. **Enhance Monitoring:** Add additional monitoring for traffic sources and patterns, and set up alerts for unusual traffic spikes.
3. **Perform Load Testing:** Schedule quarterly load testing sessions to test the system’s performance under various load conditions.
4. **Review Load Balancer Configurations:** Optimize load balancer settings to ensure efficient distribution of traffic.
5. **Document Incident Handling Protocols:** Develop and distribute a detailed incident response plan for handling traffic-related outages.
6. **Team Training:** Conduct training sessions for the engineering and DevOps teams on the updated protocols and tools.
By implementing these corrective and preventative measures, we aim to prevent similar outages in the future and ensure a more resilient and responsive infrastructure.

#Postmortem: Website Outage on August 17, 2024
##Issue Summary

Sometimes it feels like the servers have a mind of their own!

###Duration of the Outage:
**Start:** August 17, 2024, 09:00 AM UTC
**End:** August 17, 2024, 10:30 AM UTC

###Impact:
Our main e-commerce website was completely inaccessible, showing users a "503 Service Unavailable" error. Approximately 85% of users were affected, leading to significant revenue loss and a surge in customer complaints. This might explain why our support team now has 20 new voicemails, all featuring the word "urgent."

###Root Cause:
The root cause was a traffic spike due to a promotional event that overwhelmed our servers. Our auto-scaling policy was not prepared for such enthusiastic shoppers.

##Timeline
-08:55 AM UTC: Promotional email sent out, igniting the traffic storm.
-09:00 AM UTC: Monitoring system had a mild panic attack and alerted us about high CPU usage.
-09:05 AM UTC: The on-call engineer gulped down coffee and started investigating.
-09:10 AM UTC: Suspected DDoS attack (because why not?) and began checking network traffic.
-09:20 AM UTC: Web servers tapped out. Incident escalated to the DevOps superheroes.
-09:30 AM UTC: Found that the traffic was legitimate—our customers really love discounts!
-09:45 AM UTC: Manually scaled up server instances, hoping it was enough.
-10:00 AM UTC: More servers online, yet still no website. Cue more coffee.
-10:15 AM UTC: Adjusted the load balancer to spread out the traffic.
-10:30 AM UTC: Website back online, users happy, support team still recovering.

##Root Cause and Resolution

###Root Cause:
Our servers were blindsided by an unexpected surge in traffic from a promotional event. The auto-scaling policy was as effective as a chocolate teapot under these conditions, leading to server crashes.

###Resolution:
We resolved the issue by manually scaling up server instances and tweaking the load balancer to better distribute the traffic. The promotional event was put on pause temporarily, allowing us to make these changes without further disruptions.

##Corrective and Preventative Measures

###Improvements:

1. **Auto-scaling Configuration:** Reconfigure auto-scaling policies to better handle sudden traffic increases, especially during promotions.
2. **Monitoring Enhancements:** Implement detailed monitoring for traffic patterns and server performance, with more specific alerts.
3. **Load Testing:** Regularly perform load testing to ensure the system can handle peak loads without breaking a sweat.
4. **Communication Protocol:** Establish a streamlined communication protocol for quick escalation and resolution of similar incidents in the future.

###Task List:

1. **Update Auto-scaling Policy:** Modify settings to trigger earlier and add more instances as needed.
2. **Enhance Monitoring:** Integrate additional monitoring for traffic sources and patterns with improved alert systems.
3. **Perform Load Testing:** Schedule quarterly load testing sessions to simulate high-traffic scenarios.
4. **Review Load Balancer Configurations:** Optimize load balancer settings to ensure efficient traffic distribution.
5. **Document Incident Handling Protocols:** Develop and distribute a detailed incident response plan for handling traffic-related outages.
6. **Team Training:** Conduct training sessions for the engineering and DevOps teams on the updated protocols and tools.

##Closing Note
Remember, every outage is an opportunity to improve. Just like your favorite video game, every level-up comes after facing a boss fight. Let’s turn this downtime into our uptime next time!


*Servers be like: "I’m back and better than ever!"
